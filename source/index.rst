A Library for Representing Belief States 
==========================================
**beliefs** is a Python v2 library that was developed by `Dustin Smith <http://web.media.mit.edu/~dustin/>`__ as part of his PhD research on natural language processing.  It is covered under the `GPLv3 license <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>`__, which (in short)  means it is open source and all derivations must remain so.

Common operations on Belief States
==================================

Before you can use this library you must `download it <https://github.com/EventTeam/beliefs>`__ and add it to your Python's import path.  When you have done this, you will be able to import it and start using belief states:: 

  from beliefs import *

Belief states are *about* a referential domain, so they are typically initialized by passing them a referential domain::

  r = ReferentialDomain()
  b = BeliefState(r)

A **referential domain** can be any container for the entities, each an instance of :py:class:`dicts.DictCell`, which has a method for accessing them called :meth:`r.iter_entities`.  In a later section, :ref:`create-domain`, I will describe how to define the entities for a referential domain.

Two ways to view a belief state
--------------------------------
A belief state can be viewed *intensionally*, as an attribute-value matrix, or *extensionally*, as a set of its referents.
       
.. note::

    I will use the word **referents** in a technical sense to mean "all valid groupings of **entities** in the referential domain".  They should not be confused with entities. Entities are always individual items, whereas referents are sets, which in some cases may only contain singletons.

To see how many referents are in a belief state, call the method :meth:`.BeliefState.size`.  This would return 63 for the currently empty belief state because our referential domain, :math:`R`, has 6 members, and an empty belief state will always have :math:`2^{|R|}-1` possible members.  

One way to visualize the intensional content of a belief state is to simply use :keyword:`print`.  Another way is to call :meth:`~BeliefState.to_latex`. This method produces an attribute-value matrix (depends on `avm.sy <https://www.essex.ac.uk/linguistics/external/clmt/latex4ling/avms/>`__) and when rendered looks like this:

.. image:: empy_beliefstate_avm.png

The 63 referents are are only implicitly represented.  If we want to enumerate the extension of the belief state, we can call :meth:`~BeliefState.iter_referents`::

  b.iter_referents()  # returns iter object

  # loops over the iterator of just the referent's indices
  for targetset in b.iter_referents_tuples():
    print targetset 

Changing beliefs
-----------------
To add or update a belief state's property, use the :meth:`~BeliefState.merge` method.  This method requires two arguments, a `path` and a `value`.   `path` should be a list that specifies the component that should be updated, and `value` should be an instance of a :class:`.cells.Cell`.  For example::

   value = IntervalCell(5, 100)
   b.merge(['target', 'size'], value)

If the corresponding path doesn't exist (as it doesn't here), the belief state will add it and we can now access it::

  b['target']['size']  # => [5, 100]
  b.size() # => 63 

We can also change the belief state's meta-data in a similar way::

  b.merge(['targetset_arity'], 2)   # 2 gets typecast to IntervalCell(2, 2)
  b.size() # => 15

Because :math:`{6\choose 2}=15`;  there are 15 unique target sets of size two in this belief state.  If we want to see them by their indices::

  print list(b.iter_referents_tuples())  # => [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]

Parts of a belief state
-----------------------
By default, a belief state contains the following attributes and values:

:target: an attribute-value matrix describing properties that a referent in the domain must entail to be considered consistent with the belief state.

:distractor: 
  an attribute-value matrix describing properties that a referent in the domain *must not* entail to be considered consistent with the belief state. This allows it to represent negative assertions.

:target_arity:
  an interval (initially :math:`[0,\infty))` representing the valid sizes of a target set.

:constrast_arity:
  an interval (initially :math:`[0,\infty))` representing the valid sizes of the difference in the sizes of a target set and the set containing all consistent referents.

:part_of_speech:
  a symbol (initially `S` representing the previous actionâ€™s part of speech.

:deferred_effects:
  a list (initially empty) that holds effect functions and the trigger **part\_of\_speech** symbol that indicates when the function will be executed on the belief state. 

Comparing belief states to entities in the referential domain
--------------------------------------------------------------
The core responsibly of the belief state is to maintain a develop a description about the intended group of entities in the referential domain.  Within all of the elements that produce or act on the referents, e.g. :meth:`~BeliefState.size`, :meth:`~BeliefState.iter_referents` and :meth:`~BeliefState.iter_referents_tuples`, there is a check to see which entities *entail* the belief state's **target** description and *do not entail* its **distractor** description.  This can be achieved by using the :meth:`~BeliefState.entails` method or its inverse, :meth:`~BeliefState.is_entailed_by`::

  for entity in r.iter_entities():

    # does the belief state's target contain a subset of the information in entity?
    print b['target'].is_entailed_by(entity)  

    # does the belief state's target contain at least all of the information of entity?
    print b['target'].entails(entity)

    # do they both entail each other: are they equal?
    print b['target'].is_equal(entity)

You probably will not have to compute entailment to the entities in the referential domain yourself because the belief state does this for you in the higher level methods.  However, it is useful to know that each subclass of :class:`Cell` can be tested for entailment or equality using these methods.

Copying belief states
---------------------
Another useful method is :meth:`.BeliefState.copy`, which is what you'll use to create a copy of the belief state.  It's highly optimized (but there's still room for improvement!) so that only the mutable components of its cells are copied by value, the rest are copied by reference.  You will want to call this whenever you generate a successor during a search over belief states::

  b2 = b.copy()
  b2.is_equal(b)   # => True
  b2 == b          # => True (__eq__ points to is_equal)
  id(b2) == id(b)  # => False

.. _create-domain:

Creating a referential domain
=============================

The elements in the  referential domain must be represented by objects that are instances of :class:`dicts.DictCell`---essentially they are a collection of (potentially nested) attribute-value pairs.  Beneath the hood, belief states are :class:`.dicts.DictCell`; however only its properties `target` and `distractor` are explicitly compared with the referential domain.

Another way to author the referential domain is to use the :class:`.Referent` class. It's a subclass of :class:`.dicts.DictCell` with some additional object-oriented features, which allow you to use inheritance::

	import sys
	from beliefs.referent import *

	class SpatialObject(Referent):
	    """ Represents the properties of an object located in 3D space """
	    def __init__(self):
	        super(SpatialObject, self).__init__()
	        self.x_position = IntervalCell()
	        self.y_position = IntervalCell()
	        self.z_position = IntervalCell()

	class PhysicalObject(SpatialObject):
	    """ Represents objects that occupy space"""
	    def __init__(self):
	        super(PhysicalObject, self).__init__()
	        self.length = IntervalCell()
	        self.width = IntervalCell()
	        self.height = IntervalCell()

	class LanguageProducer(Referent):
	    """Something that produces a natural language"""
	    def __init__(self):
	        super(LanguageProducer, self).__init__()
	        self.language = SetIntersectionCell(['en', 'fr', 'de', 'pt', 'sp'])

	class House(SpatialObject):
	    """A dwelling"""
	    def __init__(self):
	        super(House, self).__init__()
	        self.bathrooms = IntervalCell(0, 1000)

	class Human(PhysicalObject, LanguageProducer):
	    """ A physical object that produces language and has a home """
	    def __init__(self):
	        super(Human, self).__init__()
	        self.name = StringCell()
	        self.possessions = DictCell({'home': House()})


	TaxonomyCell.initialize(sys.modules[__name__])


That `TaxonomyCell.initialize` weirdness at the end will automatically generate a :class:`.posets.PartialOrderedCell` property called `kind` with the inheritance structure of your :class:`.Referent` subclasses. Each entity will be given its class name, its most specific `kind`, as the initial value::

        dustin = Human()
        dustin['name'].merge("Dustin")  # you can also use (see warning):   dustin['name'] = "Dustin"  
        dustin['kind'] #=> Human
        dustin['kind'].to_dotfile()  #=> writes TaxonomyCell.dot

By calling :meth:`.posets.PartialOrderedCell.to_dotfile`, a DOT file will appear that shows the inheritance structure:

.. image:: TaxonomyCell.png

.. warning::
  You are encouraged to get in the habit of using :meth:`~Cell.merge`: instead of Python's built in assignment operator, :keyword:`=`, to set a value for a cell.  Although :class:`dicts.DictCell` will try to try to treat the assignment as a merge, it will only work for preexisting attributes.  This means, for example, when you use :meth:`.BeliefState.merge`, which has the additional feature of **creating new cells** when they do not exist, you *must* use :meth:`~BeliefState.merge` and not :keyword:`=`.


Cell types
-----------
These are type subclasses of :py:class:`Cell` data containers, which accumulate and maintain the consistency of *partial information* updates (via `merge()` operations).

- :py:class:`bools.BoolCell` three-valued logic of `True`, `False`, and `Unknown`.
- :py:class:`dicts.DictCell` a labeled set, like a Python `dict` that pairs attributes with cell values.
- :py:class:`numeric.IntervalCell` a bounded interval or cardinal number
- :py:class:`sets.SetIntersectionCell` a set, unordered collection of symbols, where merges are intersective and information is thereby monotonically decreasing
- :py:class:`lists.LinearOrderedCell` a bounded sequence of ordered symbols
- :py:class:`lists.PrefixCell` maintains sequences with shared elements
- :py:class:`posets.PartialOrderedCell` maintains a taxonomy of information

Specific types of classes are expected to only be merged with cells of their same type.  There are a few exceptions where the merged value is first converted into a cell of the corresponding type.
